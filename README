Version 2

URIC is a library that analyses URIs and transform them. It is designed to
be fast and occupy as few memory as possible. The basic usage of this
library is to transform an URI into a structure with one field for each
component of the URI and vice versa. It is available as a C library and
as a Perl library.

The documentation is in urilib/uri.3 manual page and contains
a few examples. The module providing a direct interface to this library
is URIC. Here is a short usage example:

use URIC;
$uri = "http://www.dummy.fr/foo?bar";
$uri_object = uri_alloc($uri, length($uri));
print uri_path($uri_object) . "\n";

An attempt to provide a module compatible with URI::URL module may be
found in URI2::URL. It is 95% compatible (see at the beginning of the
URL.pm file for incomptibilities) and runs 3 times faster. I'm still 
working on it.
